The sad thing is that Russia and China are bad guys but we have completely destroyed our own moral authority to grandstand on the world stage.

I put in my conscientious objector status back in 2019 when they called me up for muster just a few days after they tried to get us to go to war with Iran, again... 

And now a quote from a man wiser than me.

War is a racket. It always has been.

I spent thirty- three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country‚Äôs most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle- man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.

62103,UgyiPaoiXLWuPAB8gPR4AaABAg,"I personally  join United States Army Reserve 
I signed up for 8 years contract

way back in 1985


 and

 starting  boot camp at  Fort Campbell Kentucky November 1st 1985


 way back then


 but 

unfortunately 
because
 of my ethnicity and where I was raised at


 I was basically told that I was going to send out of boot camp and sent back home


I guess I was not well liked because of my cultural background

 especially

 because

 I was raised and born in New York City with Caribbean Island and Hispanic Cultural ties and identity


I was personally told this several times by adrenal instructor to my face and one time it was actually in front of a px purchasing shoe polish and other necessities while serving in boot camp

Obviously I was very saddened üòîü§îüòåby this and very disappointed

 but

 that was reality way back in 1985 especially at Fort Campbell Kentucky




Another disappointing situation is that  now 2022 


Young Americans are not interested in joining the military anymore


 it is dwindling


 the mindset to serve your country

 or

 to spend some time in the military 



to stabilize you as a young person 


a right of passage of maturity and as well as being wise and serving a few years in the American military 


to give you a little perspective 

 immaturity 


and


 maybe even a vocation resulting from military training


Recruitment is very low in the military in the United States and that breaks my heart üíî Because deep inside I'm very patriotic 


Including at least nine different Caribbean Hispanic Island family members who also join the military 

but

 two of them was rejected for whatever reason 

whatever particular emotional situation they will send back home unfortunately

41947,UgwEXIjeqIcWhIQTkb14AaABAg,"I can't believe that we let this happen! There is no turning back now. There is no honor or nothing sacred anymore.  I was stationed at FT BRAGG  and spent some of the best years of my life there with some of the bravest and badest soldiers in the Military.  We were constantly indoctrinated with tradition an honor and we fought to uphold these things. Some clowns ü§° at the DOD just came in totally un opposed and changed the names of these bases. Ft. Bragg was the name of the base we trained,  lived formed a brotherhood and friendships that last a lifetime.  The name Bragg is tied to all these memories it has nothing to do with the Confederate General from NC that lost more battles for the south that he actually helped the north. But the name Bragg you just cannot change and erase you might as well piss on all the Graves of the soldiers that left Ft Bragg to defend this country and never came home! If you did not live there or were not stationed there you know nothing of this. They started by changing the names of products like Aunt Jemima pancakes, syrup. Did that really make a fckn difference.  America as I know it is gone we have been destroyed not by a foreign enemy but by something far worse some Agenda that has warped the minds of are children and they have done away with any sense of rational logic . No one was honoring General Bragg but we reflected on a time when brothers fought brothers over some ideology and if we don't remember this dark time in are past we are doomed to repeat it and I'm afraid the actions of are government and leaders starting with giving in to this new agenda that is tearing are Country apart is leading us to another even darker chapter in our country's history üíî",Brian P Cooper,UC9baOiAHKsaDH07sWo0CJLw,10,6/4/2023 21:47,UgwEXIjeqIcWhIQTkb14AaABAg,ugEys1lbicA,Fort Liberty: Honoring the value of service | U.S. Army,"On June 2, 2023, Fort Bragg was redesignated as Fort Liberty in commemoration of the American value of liberty.

105267,UgzXGvMDbUSvE__LMAN4AaABAg,"I looked at the comments on a couple other spots and they look like these. There's no doubt leadership fu**** up on the changes in policy and tolerance for ideological BS.   This nation is going to be in serious trouble if they don't come straight out and admit to the world what they were trying to do and name the forces they were bowing to - and detail to the American public the standards of operation they're returning to.  And those standards need to be whatever was in place during the 3-5 years BEFORE their highest recruitment successes.  When they were weeding out people they didn't want. When they had so many and such good applicants they could be a selective service. And they need to get real.  Their ""audience"" - their ""customer base"" isn't people who were happy about the Target/Bud Light/ Trans-Navy crap.   People need to know that they're going to serve in the military their parents and grandparents served in and that they're job stress will be about doing the most important job in the US  - not worrying about hurting people's feelings who aren't mentally well enough to do the job if they themselves are that worried about their feelings. Harassment is one thing... real harassment.  But  the people in our military need to be the mentally and emotionally and socially toughest, best balanced, and most well people in our nation.

In the coming months, the system will start to back down  on a few woke issues due to concern about lack of participation of White Men in the upcoming war. They know their diversity mutts are disloyal cowards and are incapable of winning a war. They will first use their puppets like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk to lay the groundwork for certain ideas to be allowed to be pushed back on. 

They know White Men have checked out of participation in society and conflict and that they've whipped White Men too hard recently with a lot of the woke nonsense. So they will roll back just enough of said woke nonsense in time in hopes of remoralizing White Men to go fight and die in their meatgrinder of a conflict. 

*MOST IMPORTANT*
They still want to erradicate White Western Man, do not be fooled by certain concessions the system makes, they still want to genocide you.

130114,UgyWSiicrJJHnkREQ5N4AaABAg,"Hey Army, read the room. I've got a NCO buddy being asked ""What can we do to improve recruiting numbers?""

What can he say? Nothing that you want to hear. 

Many comments are about not wanting to fight/die for foreign/Israeli/politician wars. 
Many comments are about not wanting to fight/die for a country that persecutes white males
Many comments are about wokeness killing everything.

READ THE ROOM, ARMY! In 2007, your numbers were so bad you thought of reinstating the draft. I personally witnessed deceptive practices occurring then for recruiting such as providing black drill sgts ""pimped out rides"" to drive to show kids ""You too can be gangsta"" and other things like lowering standards, adjusting PT to accomodate unqualified and unfit, women for combat, etc. You have learned nothing, especially under Liberal ""leadership"" and college graduate ""officers"" leadership that we ALL KNOW ""college isn't the home of patriotism"".

""US Army... read the room"". You want a suggestion? Here's some:

Stop proving Millennial lack of creativity by nostalgia grabbing and regurgitating former ad campaigns

Start being more AMERICA FIRST and less money laundering for politicians/liberals/Israel in foreign wars for foreign borders to encroach or destabilize foreign nations

Stop persecuting manhood

Shut Milley and his ""white rage""  bull DOWN NOW

Stop requiring West Point cadets to wear heels to experience life as a woman

Stop with the DEI garbage

Stop attempting to force wokeism 

Bring God, not degeneracy, deviancy, and sin in to your ad campaigns

Stop attempting to coerce and bribe people in to joining. Didn't work for the vax

Stop VIOLATING things like the Nuremberg Code with forced medical experimentation, like you did with the vax

Stop allowing ""the commander in chief of the time"" to use the Military as his petri dish playground to try social engineering experiments and get back to putting boot to ass for America, and not Israel.",jacobsladder74,UCjHUtAJpgpj8JYz2TWY3_gA,9,3/30/2023 14:13,UgyWSiicrJJHnkREQ5N4AaABAg,Lwx-2R9swDg,Be All You Can Be - U.S. Army's new brand trailer | U.S. Army,"Soldiers know what it means to Be All You Can Be.

Two unique events in our Nations History that are so intertwined. With all that our Nation is facing internally, it seems that the only thing for certain that we can depend on, is the loyalty and dedication of our Army. I know that there is a lot of discussion about the Army going back to the phrase ""Be All You Can Be!"" As a Soldier for Life, who served from 72-92, this phrase makes more sense today and is actually more than just a slogan. It is something to strive for, a goal for which we all should strive to be everyday.  To all the parents who have sons and daughters in the Army, thank you for all you do to support them. For all those who are looking for a role model, the American Soldier is that role model. They are the ones who wear the jersey of a real hero. They are the ones who place needs of others before their own. Go Army!!",Richard Oliver,UC3hMiaCx23ds09nwDHgFJgg,3,6/14/2023 11:14,UgxK1mraLm-vRnE_1gh4AaABAg,Bcfk1WHC33o,Happy 248th Birthday! | U.S. Army,"The U.S. Army has provided countless possibilities to soldiers of all backgrounds.

The size of the Army right now is about the same size before the start of WWII.

And these guys are pushing all sorts of stuff that has nothing to do with making the military ready for war.  And they are discriminating against white people who make up the large amounts of folk who join.

I was in the Army in the early '90s and most of my platoons were white males.  There was usually about 3 or 4 blacks and 3 or so Hispanics, which I am Hispanic.
