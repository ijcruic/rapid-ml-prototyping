It should be noted that if you want to use a decoder-only model (i.e., Llama, Mistral, etc.) you need to switch to a `text-generation` pipeline. Also, setting `return_full_text=False` when using a text-generation pipeline is also helpful as it just returns what the model generates and not the full prompt.\n",
