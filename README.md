# Code for _Rapid Prototyping of ML Solutions_

![Rapid ML Prototyping](images/project_picture.png)

The overall objective for this codebase is to give you instruction on machine learning such that you, in the course of the work in your field, can quickly apply machine learning tools to your problems. It is not meant to make one an expert in data science or to teach the foundations of data literacy, but rather teach a domain expert (i.e. someone who does not work in data science for a living) how to quickly implement machine learning solutions for possible use cases in their domain work roles. The presented techniques can also be useful for seasoned data scientists as well :smiley:.

## Rapidly Implementing ML Solutions


#### Some Tips...

:white_medium_square:__Narrowly and specifically design the problem__

:white_medium_square:__Use existing code/models/workflows/insights whenever possible__

:white_medium_square:__Start simple and basic, and build more complexity over iterations__

:white_medium_square:__Stay data-centric in your approach__
